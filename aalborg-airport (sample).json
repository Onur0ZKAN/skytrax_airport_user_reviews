And on top of all this you get free water and a newspaper while you wait for the plane. The best by far.",

Better signs and maybe announcements - would do a big difference!",

Airside you will find a small shop with pre-packed sandwiches and hot dogs and other small stuff a small duty free shop is also around but not very cheap. There is no Lounge to be found at the moment but after the expansion is completed there will be one available (around May 2013). Check-in procedures are fast and the waiting area after check-in is fine with a view on the tarmac. All in all a nice modern but small airport with expensive restaurants and shop.",

Check-in efficient and hassle-free using self-service kiosks. Free Internet computers are available landside - a nice touch. Security staff very friendly.

SAS is really the only game in town once you get in and be prepared for delays on flights to/from Copenhagen (a 35-min. flight). Extremely clean as is the Danish way. Ground staff and crews are helpful enough but to any seasoned traveller this is a backwater airport. Again the SAS AAL-CPH-AAL leg is notorious for delays each week so if you have connecting flights out of CPH plan accordingly. Also upon arrival at AAL there are not always enough taxis waiting outside and you might have to wait a few minutes. Buses run into town on a regular basis but everthing at this small airport - taxis buses kiosk opening hours etc. - are all timed to coincide with arrivals and departures of flights from CPH.",
